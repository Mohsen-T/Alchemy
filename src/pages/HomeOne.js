        Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO) are the cornerstone of
        trustless engagement and operation on the Blockchain. With DAOâ€™s, we are
        able to create symbiotic self funded financial ecosystems that operate
        with mutual goals to achieve what was once impossible yesterday,
        today...

        <BigBox header="Create Your Organization" imgName="organization.png">
          Alchemy allows any Runes community to create a DAO with ease. All it
          takes is a bit of Bitcoin and your Xverse or Unisat wallet. Options
          are limitless with Alchemy, this means you are given a diverse range
          of features and plug-ins that help to make your DAO uniquely suited to
          meet the needs of your community.

        <BigBox header="Establish Your Membership" imgName="membership.png">
          Membership can be defined in a multitude of ways on Alchemy including
          designating specific Runes or Ordinals as Access Passes or Membership
          IDs before a person can access your DAO. Once your members are
          established, create Councils to help create checks and balances for
          your organization.
